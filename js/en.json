    "about_main_text": "Today’s cybersecurity solutions are limited. As one of the main providers finds a threat, it will often take significant time for that knowledge to be distributed. New malware takes advantage of this window of time to infect the greatest number of devices. LevelNet creates an integrate, global, and immediately responsive system to stop more malware and earlier than heretofore possible.<br><br>As new cyber-security systems emerge they seamlessly integrate into the LevelNet network to further enhance overall protection.<br><br>If you have ever contemplated the inner workings of Cyber Security or you are a fan of new revolutionary technologies, take a look at our White Paper!",
    "about_col1_title": "PROBLEM",
    "about_col1_text": "The threat of malware has existed since the dawn of the computer age. As technology has advanced, so has the sophistication of the viruses, exploits, and other attacks meant to harm our personal data. Unfortunately, traditional anti-virus software has failed to progress in tandem. In many cases, such software is no longer able to sufficiently keep up with the constant influx of new malicious software that plague that digital world.<br><br>Different anti-virus services discover issues as diverse times, meaning not everyone is protected at the same rate. The process by which updates are provided to guard against these new threats is complicated, and leads to many users being left unprotected for extended periods. Programs must first be informed of new threats to quarantine. Then, the developers create an update for the customers, so that their software will be able to look for the updated library of attacks. Customers must accept the update before their computer can be protected.<br><br>This ever-repeating timeline of events has made it nearly impossible to provide up-to-date protection to individual consumers on a global scale.",

    "faq_about_question_1": "So is this like an antivirus?",
    "faq_about_answer_1": "It's just like an antivirus, but it's not an classic antivirus. It is a network for exchanging antivirus protection between users. For users it is end-point protection solution app.<br>LevelNet allows to protect users against the latest attacks that occur on the Internet about which antivirus vendors have not managed to secure their users.<br>LevelNet client application receiving information from other users of the network,protects the device from attacks that were fixed by users with the same application.<br><br>For example:<br>User #1 was susceptible to an attack on the Internet and Avast was installed. Avast blocked this attack.<br>User #2 was also susceptible to attack on the Internet and it had NOD32 installed.<br>Nod32 could not block the virus.<br>User #3 does not have an antivirus.<br>Result: Users #2 #3 was infected with a virus.<br><br>If users #1, #2 and #3 had LevelNet app, then users #2 and #3 would not have been infected with the virus since.<br>The LevelNet app will block the virus.<br><br>For better understanding of the video. Imagine that virtual machines are different users who are in different parts of the world.<br>Please look through until the end I answer some important questions at the end of the video.<br><a href='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fDLfvA9EqNU' target='_blank'>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fDLfvA9EqNU<a>",
    "faq_about_question_2": "Do I need to uninstall my other antivirus?",
    "faq_about_answer_2": "No, you do not need to uninstall your antivirus.<br>The Levelnet app greatly enhances the capabilities of any antivirus and it is compatible with other software.<br>Our application can be used both with the installed antivirus, and without antivirus.<br>If you will use without the installed anti-virus, then you will receive protection from other users.<br>If used with an already installed antivirus, you will not only receive protection, but share your security updates.",
    "faq_about_question_3": "So there will be a peer to peer network in the product. Now is this network secure, and encrypted?",
    "faq_about_answer_3": "Authentication of requests (transactions) between nodes of the network occurs by checking the digital signature, each request.<br>If an attacker sends a false request to the network or to an open port of the node, the node will not accept it, because the digital signature will not match the private key.<br>Each request coming from the node is checked on the server by false positive and once the information is confirmed it generates a request for broadcast to the peer-to-peer network.<br>This request is signed with a private key.",
    "faq_about_question_4": "How difficult is it for another user to hack the peer network since it has already connected to the open port of other computers?",
    "faq_about_answer_4": "A transaction in a LevelNet network is a network request containing information about the object being checked.<br>This transaction can be signed by a management server or a trusted node, with a private RSA key.<br>The signature of this transaction is carried out with the intention of not being able to forge a request by a third party.<br><br>LevelNet application opens the port in listen mode and waits for a request from neighboring nodes. As I said already above, if the request came with an incorrect digital signature<br>Then this request will not be processed.",
    "faq_about_question_5": "Do you think there is a way for anti-viruses to implement countermeasures against your application and p2p Network?",
    "faq_about_answer_5": "Yes, there are opportunities for countermeasures by anti-virus programs. We divided them into 2 technological and legal groups.<br>Technological countermeasures are laid in the very architecture our technology.<br>We plan to resolve the legal issues as they occur, as well as with the help of our users.<br>We hope that our users will realize the value of our technology and will not allow anti-virus companies to press on us.<br>Technological problems also turn into legal flatness.<br>For example, antivirus companies may conspire and prohibit their users from installing our application by applying a signature to our executable file.<br>This problem from the technological to the legal. We have prepared a whole block of countermeasures against antivirus countermeasures.<br>Now we do not want to sound the apparent measure taken by us. This will reveal our plans.",
    "faq_about_question_6": "Can you describe how LevelNet interacts with other virus scanners? It looks like from the demo video, LevelNet was able to read the results of other virus scanner and propagate that information across the chain.",
    "faq_about_answer_6": "We preform a system analysis on calls in the operating system relative to each object that is scanned by anti-virus software.",
    "faq_about_question_7": "Does LevelNet only analyze the end result of the virus scan? So basically, it wouldn't know a malware is a malware beforehand, until one antivirus scanner picks up on it?

This is being done in an effort to promote equitable, ongoing exchangeability for our participants following the success of our Coin Offering.<\/p><p>Many ICO’s have seen a similar problem, following the conclusion of their sales. Once an offering has ended, speculation surrounding the token begins to take hold, as contributors seek a quick and profitable exit. With no product, and therefore no utility by which tokens may be measured, asset values plummet once they have been listed for third party exchange. Projects who fail to take these facts into account do a significant disservice to both themselves, and their contributors.<\/p><h2>How is LevelNet solving this issue and protecting contributors?<\/h2><p>Simple, our ICO will only be considered successful in the event that our Soft Cap of $1.5M has been reached. Once this goal has been achieved, the money will be divided into several funds, specifically aimed at maintaining the liquidity of our LVL token.<\/p><p>Depending on the number of tokens sold during our coin offering, up to 40% of the funds raised will be transitioned into our ‘Buyback Fund’; a reserve whose function is to frequently buyback tokens, as the parameters of the funds smart contract have been met.<\/p><p>In the event that our Hard Cap of $50m is obtained, another development fund will be formed in the amount of 35%. This money will be used to fund LevelNet’s implementation and marketing strategy for two years.<\/p><p>By taking these steps, LevelNet hopes to ensure the stability of our token, and act in good faith to protect the best interests of our contributors for years to come.<\/p>",
    "button_box_2_text": "<h1>Exit strategy for LVL tokens holders issued by LevelNet.<\/h1><p>We took into account interests of diverse user groups and contributors and provide three exit strategies.<\/p><p>1. Short-term (up to one year)<br \/>The growth of the token in the price on the crypto currency exchanges due to the provision of liquidity by a smart contract that performs the function of a buyback with the help of funds from the Buyback Fund. Smart contract automatically redeems tokens from the market by creating Market Order. Smart contract algorithms actually indicate to market participants that they can always sell tokens at a market price without delays, creating a demand for tokens. The buyback fund is formed at the expense of funds received during the ITO and the buy-back runs till the funds are exhausted in the fund.<\/p><p>2. Long-term (one year and more)<br \/>Tokens owners who have not sold their tokens in a short-term strategy receive a preemptive right to exchange a token for a stake in the fund whose purpose is to acquire local cyber security companies with the subsequent integration of LevelNet technology into their products. The Fund provides for a gradual decrease in the equity participation of founders and transfer to participants, who invested in the following phases of ITO.<br \/>Owning a share in the fund opens the possibility of participating in the distribution of profits.<br \/>Payout Structure A smart contract allows token owners to receive payment from the Money Back and Buyback funds starting from the 60th day after the offering.<\/p><p>3. Output in the product (year and more)<br \/>Tokens owners get access to using the LevelNet project software. Besides opens the ability to exchange tokens for subscription to use the API and SDK for corporate users. This, in turn, allows tokens owners to sell subscriptions to corporate and business users.<\/p>",
